### Clue 3: Humans vs. Machines ###

#### Find Clue 4 ####

Your hint for clue 4 is the file `/etc/hostname`. This file contains a single
word, which is the name of your computer. This name is your hint. Remember we
can find the next hint by typing

    python next_clue.py [next clue number] [hint]

#### `less` ####

Less is a program that allows you to view files in a terminal. Unlike `cat`,
you can scroll through the file using your arrow keys and space bar. After you
navigate to clue 4, try doing `less clue` instead of `cat clue`.
