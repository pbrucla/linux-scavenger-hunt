### Clue 12: The Final Frontier ###

#### Finding the Final Clue ####

Using everything you've learned so far, and the fact that the real clues are
different from the fake clues (what is the first line of every real clue file?),
find the final clue using only linux commands!
You may need to do some googling or man page reading, but you can use a command you
already know!

Hint: try using the `grep` command!
